# perceptron
Simple Perceptron Implementation in C

## Usage
Compile:
```bash
make -B
```

Then, run it:
```bash
./main
```

## Demo
Below is a gif demonstrating the learning process of the perceptron algorithm. In this example, it successfully learns to linearly separate the labeled points, effectively implementing the AND function:
